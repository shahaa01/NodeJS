# Node.js Fundamentals

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository documents my in-depth learning and hands-on application of **Node.js**, a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It covers core concepts, file operations, process handling, and module management, providing a solid foundation for backend development.

## ðŸš€ **Topics Covered**
- **Node REPL:** 
  - Used the **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** to interactively run JavaScript code directly in the terminal.
  - Executed basic commands and experimented with **variables, functions, and objects**.
- **Node Files:** 
  - Worked with **file system operations** to read, write, and append data to files.
  - Practiced asynchronous and synchronous file handling using `fs` module.
- **Process in Node:**
  - Explored the `process` object to access environment variables, arguments, and manage the **current runtime environment**.
  - Used `process.argv` to handle **command-line arguments**.
- **Export in Files:** 
  - Learned how to export individual functions, objects, or variables from a **single file** using `module.exports`.
- **Export in Directories:** 
  - Organized multiple modules by exporting them collectively from **directory-based modules**.
- **What is NPM:** 
  - Understood the **Node Package Manager (NPM)** and its role in managing project dependencies.
- **Installing Packages:** 
  - Installed third-party packages using `npm install` and experimented with both **local and global installations**.
- **package.json:** 
  - Learned how to initialize a `package.json` file and manage project metadata.
  - Explored adding dependencies, scripts, and versioning.
- **Local vs Global Installation:** 
  - Differentiated between **local and global package installations**.
  - Used local installations for project-specific dependencies and global for reusable tools.
- **Import Modules:** 
  - Imported both **core and custom modules** into Node.js applications using `require()`.

## ðŸ”¥ **Key Takeaways**
- Gained practical experience in **file system operations** and process management.
- Mastered **module exports and imports**, enhancing code reusability.
- Learned how to use **NPM** to install, manage, and track project dependencies.
- Worked with **local and global installations** for efficient package management.
